			<h2>Hello.</h2>

			<p>Hi, I’m Nitya. I am a current freshman at Case Western and I am studying biomedical engineering in the computational track along with a minor in computer science. My interests lie in improving medical diagnosis and prognosis through any means of technology, specifically the newly emerging field of Radiomics. Aside from my research, I enjoy reading the recent advances in my field done around the world and am fascinated by the accuracy of machine learning in medicine. Outside of academics, I enjoy any medium of art with emphasis on painting and sketching and playing violin covers to existing melodies. With my education, I hope to make significant advances in the biomedical field while expanding my knowledge and experience.</p>

			<p>I am currently looking for internships for the Summer of 2018. TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT IN A JOB HERE</p>

						<p style="font-size: 12pt">
							In many types of cancerous tumors, diagnosis proves to be quite difficult due to the MRI or PET image lacking certain qualities that are helpful. Unlike CT scans, MRI and PET scans have yet to be quantified, leaving room for error given that all diagnosis and prognosis from an MRI is purely qualitative. Under the guidance of Dr. Satish Viswanath, I am amidst developing machine learning algorithms and medical image analysis in order to aid pathological advances such as treatment diagnosis and therapeutic procedures done after ablation of prostate cancer. We acquire certain Radiomic features that show to be most variant, such as intensity values, computed by the resulting images from MRI and PET scans. With these features, quantification is implemented to aid doctors in diagnosis and prognosis. With the given data that radiomics supplies combined with a doctor’s experience, we can raise the accuracy of diagnosis from 48% to 92%.

						<p style="font-size: 12pt">
							Placing electrodes in the brain is a very challenging and risky process, and the biocompatibility of these electrodes has to be minimal in error to prevent a foreign body response. An increase of signaling in these electrodes allows for the physician to have better control of drug delivery or to sense the firing of neurons, which can help disease in the brain and guide movement in paralysis. Under the guidance of Dr. Allison Hess-Dunning, I am currently under investigation on processes such as reduced oxidation of graphene to improve signaling of probes in the brain. Our hypothesis is that electrochemically reducing graphene on these electrodes is the most proficient way to increase signaling, along with a glutamate neurotransmitter. Once these devices are completely reduced further investigation in mice will be conducted to observe the foreign body response.

						<p style="font-size: 12pt">
								As with many cancers, identifying a tumor suppressor aids in minimizing neoplastic regions of the cancer, preventing further growth. To aid in this process, investigated Colon Cancer in the lab at the University of Chicago under Dr. Joel Pekow. I conducted various protocols such as Western Blotting and Immunohistochemistry which helped analyze protein expression values correlated to inflammatory bowel diseases. Knowing that patients with microRNA expression due to Inflammatory Bowel Disease have 3 up regulated proteins, injecting them with a certain tumor suppressor proved to reduce this protein expression, concluding in reduction of disease. I presented my work in weekly lab meetings and worked with fellow doctors to advance the cause. My work was published in a paper and presented at university seminars and external science fairs.
